# Escape the room

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called `rooms` that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. `name`, `description`, `completed`).

rooms = {
    'room 1': {'name':'room 1','description':'abc','completed':'y'},
    'room 2': {'name':'room 2','description':'def','completed':'y'},    
    'room 3': {'name':'room 3','description':'htr','completed':'n'},
