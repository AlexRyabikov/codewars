Sometimes, I want to quickly be able to convert miles per imperial gallon (`mpg`) into kilometers per liter (`kpl`).

Create an application that will display the number of kilometers per liter (output) based on the number of miles per imperial gallon (input).

```if-not:swift
Make sure to round off the result to two decimal points.
```
```if:swift
Your answer should be accurate within 0.01 kpl.
```

Some useful associations relevant to this kata:
- 1 Imperial Gallon = 4.54609188 litres  
- 1 Mile = 1.609344 kilometres  
 """ 

def converter(mpg):
    kpl = mpg / (4.54609188 / 1.609344)
    return round(kpl, 2)
